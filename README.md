# **Handwritten Digit recogniser**

## **ðŸ“Œ Project Overview**

This project implements a handwritten digit classifier using the MNIST dataset with a Deep Neural Network (DNN) built in TensorFlow/Keras. The model is trained using the Sequential API and evaluated with various metrics.

## **ðŸ“‚ Dataset: MNIST**

MNIST is a dataset of 70,000 grayscale images (28x28 pixels) of handwritten digits (0-9).

It is divided into 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images.

Each image corresponds to a label (digit from 0 to 9).
